    <p>Here are some of my favorite hobbies:</p>
    <ul class="hobbies-list">
        <li><b style="font-size: 20px;">Chess</b></li>
        <p>One of the most underestimated type of sport that deserves to be considered as an olympic game</p>
        <br>
        <li><b style="font-size: 20px;">Swimming</b></li>
        <p>Makes me forget any problems, deadlines and helps to get back with fresh version of myself</p>
        <br>
        <li><b style="font-size: 20px;">Football</b></li>
        <p>Love to beat kids in the street who thinks that they are good at it</p>
        <br>
        <li><b style="font-size: 20px;">Volleyball</b></li>
        <p>Usually a common type of activity for boys and girls, so this game is anywhere. I had no choice to keep playing it</p>
        <br>
        <li><b style="font-size: 20px;">Table Tennis</b></li>
        <p>The favorite hobby for old men. Ask any one of them can they play a little bit, so I am sure they will respond "You wanna try me?"</p>
        <br>
        <li><b style="font-size: 20px;">Gym</b></li>
        <p>Every male that respect himself should regularly visit there</p>
        <br>
        <li><b style="font-size: 20px;">Fifa</b></li>
        <p>The world where the boys, who did not accomplished their goals as being professional football player, turn their dreams into reality</p>
        <br>
